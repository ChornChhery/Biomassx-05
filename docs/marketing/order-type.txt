In an exchange platform, order types are typically classified based on their execution conditions, duration, and pricing mechanisms. For your bioenergy exchange platform, here are some common classifications:

### 1. **Market Orders**
   - **Description**: Executes immediately at the best available price in the market.
   - **Use case**: When immediate execution is more important than the price.
   - **Example**: Buying 100 units of bioenergy at the current market price.

### 2. **Limit Orders**
   - **Description**: Executes only at a specified price or better.
   - **Use case**: When the trader wants to control the price at which the order is filled.
   - **Example**: Selling 50 units of biomass if the price reaches $50 per unit.

### 3. **Stop Orders (Stop-Loss)**
   - **Description**: Converts to a market order when a specified price is reached, protecting against significant losses.
   - **Use case**: Often used to limit potential losses or lock in profits.
   - **Example**: Setting a stop order to sell 100 units of bioenergy if the price drops to $40.

### 4. **Stop-Limit Orders**
   - **Description**: A combination of a stop order and a limit order. When the stop price is reached, the order becomes a limit order instead of a market order.
   - **Use case**: Used when you want control over both the trigger price and the execution price.
   - **Example**: Selling bioenergy at a limit of $45 when the price drops to $40.

### 5. **Fill or Kill (FOK)**
   - **Description**: The entire order must be executed immediately at the specified price, or the order is canceled.
   - **Use case**: Useful when partial fills are not acceptable.
   - **Example**: Buying 500 units of bioenergy at $48 per unit, and if the entire order cannot be filled, it’s canceled.

### 6. **Immediate or Cancel (IOC)**
   - **Description**: The order must be filled immediately, but partial fills are allowed. Any unfilled portion is canceled.
   - **Use case**: When you want as much of the order filled as possible immediately, without waiting for full execution.
   - **Example**: Buying as many bioenergy units as possible at $46, but canceling any unfilled portion.

### 7. **Good 'Til Canceled (GTC)**
   - **Description**: The order remains active until it is either filled or manually canceled.
   - **Use case**: Used when there is no rush, and you are waiting for a specific price.
   - **Example**: Selling 200 units of biomass at $52, and the order stays open until it is filled.

### 8. **Day Orders**
   - **Description**: The order remains active until the end of the trading day, after which it expires if not filled.
   - **Use case**: When the trader wants the order to be valid only for the current trading session.
   - **Example**: Buying 300 units of bioenergy at $47, but canceling if it’s not filled by the end of the day.

### 9. **All or None (AON)**
   - **Description**: The order is executed only if the entire quantity can be filled; otherwise, it remains open until canceled or filled completely.
   - **Use case**: Used when partial orders are not acceptable.
   - **Example**: Selling 1000 units of bioenergy only if all 1000 units can be sold at $50.

### 10. **Auction Orders**
   - **Description**: Orders that are only executed during an auction period, often at the opening or closing of the market.
   - **Use case**: Used to get the best price during high liquidity periods like opening or closing.
   - **Example**: Participating in an auction for biomass units at the market close.

### 11. **Trailing Stop Orders**
   - **Description**: A stop order that moves with the market price by a specified percentage or dollar amount.
   - **Use case**: Used to lock in profits while allowing for upward price movement.
   - **Example**: Setting a trailing stop for selling biomass where the stop price is 5% below the current market price.

### Customization for Bioenergy Trading:
For your bio-circular-green trading platform, you may also consider specific custom order types tailored to the sector, such as:
   - **Environmental Impact Orders**: Trades that prioritize sellers or buyers with lower carbon footprints.
   - **Compliance-based Orders**: Orders that only trigger if certain regulatory conditions are met (e.g., meeting sustainability certification standards).

Each type serves different trading strategies, and you may customize these types to fit the specific needs of bioenergy trading.
