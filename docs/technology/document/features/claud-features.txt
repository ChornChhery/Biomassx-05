1. User registration and profiles

3. Search and filter functionality
4. Real-time pricing and market data
5. Secure transaction processing
6. Messaging system for buyer-seller communication
7. Logistics and delivery tracking
8. Quality assurance and certification information
9. Analytics dashboard for market trends
10. Notification system for price alerts and new listings

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these features or discuss additional ones that might be relevant to your platform?
