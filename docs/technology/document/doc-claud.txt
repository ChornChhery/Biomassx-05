For a bioenergy exchange platform, you'll need to prepare several key documents for your tech team to ensure smooth development and implementation. Here are some essential documents you should consider:

1. Product Requirements Document (PRD):
   - Overview of the platform's purpose and goals
   - Detailed feature list
   - User stories and use cases
   - Technical requirements and constraints

2. System Architecture Design:
   - High-level system design
   - Database schema
   - API design and endpoints
   - Integration points with external systems (if any)

3. Frontend Technical Specification:
   - UI/UX design mockups and wireframes
   - Component hierarchy and structure
   - State management approach
   - Responsive design requirements
   - Browser compatibility requirements

4. Backend Technical Specification:
   - Data models and relationships
   - Business logic and algorithms
   - Security measures and authentication system
   - Performance requirements and scalability considerations

5. API Documentation:
   - Detailed description of all endpoints
   - Request/response formats
   - Authentication and authorization requirements

6. Data Flow Diagrams:
   - Visual representation of data movement within the system
   - Interactions between different components and modules

7. Test Plan:
   - Unit testing requirements
   - Integration testing scenarios
   - User acceptance testing criteria

8. Deployment Strategy:
   - Infrastructure requirements
   - Deployment process and tools
   - Monitoring and logging requirements

9. Security Guidelines:
   - Data encryption standards
   - User data protection measures
   - Compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, if applicable)

10. Project Timeline and Milestones:
    - Development phases
    - Key deliverables and deadlines

11. Technical Stack Documentation:
    - Chosen frameworks, libraries, and tools
    - Version requirements for all technologies

12. Coding Standards and Best Practices:
    - Code style guide
    - Documentation requirements
    - Version control workflow
