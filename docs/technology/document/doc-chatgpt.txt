To ensure your tech team (both frontend and backend) is aligned and productive, you'll need to prepare several key documents:

### 1. **Technical Requirements Document (TRD)**
   - **Scope**: Detailed description of platform goals, features, and user roles (e.g., sellers, buyers, admins).
   - **Tech Stack**: Define technologies for both frontend (e.g., React, HTMX, CSS frameworks) and backend (Go, PostgreSQL, REST API, JWT).
   - **User Stories/Use Cases**: Detailed flow of how users will interact with the system, including edge cases.

### 2. **System Architecture**
   - **Diagrams**: High-level architecture diagrams showing how frontend, backend, and database interact. Include microservices if applicable.
   - **Data Flow**: Specify how data flows between frontend, backend, and third-party services (if any).
   - **Deployment Pipeline**: Outline CI/CD pipeline, server setup (e.g., VPS for PostgreSQL), and development environments.

### 3. **API Documentation (Backend)**
   - **Endpoints**: List all API endpoints, their parameters, request/response formats, and error handling.
   - **Authentication**: Define authentication flows (JWT, sessions) and access control levels.
   - **Versioning**: Provide details on API versioning strategy.

### 4. **Database Schema & ERD**
   - **ER Diagrams**: Entity-Relationship diagrams showing key entities (e.g., users, listings, transactions) and relationships.
   - **Table Structures**: Define database tables, columns, indexes, and constraints.
   - **Data Migration Plan**: Strategy for handling schema changes or updates.

### 5. **Frontend UI/UX Specifications**
   - **Wireframes/Mockups**: High-level design for core pages (e.g., login, listing, dashboard) showing layout and user interaction.
   - **Style Guide**: Specify color themes (#ff6d00, #b2ff59), typography, and UI elements consistency.
   - **Component Breakdown**: If using a component-based framework (like React), define the component hierarchy and props.

### 6. **Security Policies**
   - **Authentication & Authorization**: Specify security protocols (e.g., password hashing, token management).
   - **Data Encryption**: How sensitive data (passwords, personal info) will be encrypted and stored.
   - **Vulnerability Management**: Plan for handling security vulnerabilities and regular audits.

### 7. **Testing Strategy**
   - **Unit/Integration Testing**: Define testing frameworks and coverage goals for both frontend and backend.
   - **End-to-End Testing**: Tools and strategies (e.g., Cypress) to ensure seamless integration of frontend and backend.
   - **Performance Testing**: Requirements for testing platform performance and load handling.

### 8. **DevOps and Infrastructure**
   - **Server Setup**: Instructions for setting up environments (local, staging, production).
   - **Monitoring & Logging**: Tools for monitoring (e.g., Grafana) and logging (e.g., ELK stack).
   - **Backup & Recovery**: Plan for data backups and disaster recovery.

These documents will help your tech team align on platform goals, architecture, and workflow, ensuring a smooth development process.
