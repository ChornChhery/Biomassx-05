For representing price across HTMX, Go, and PostgreSQL, here are appropriate data types to consider:

1. PostgreSQL:
   - NUMERIC or DECIMAL: These are exact, fixed-point types ideal for monetary values. They allow you to specify precision and scale.
   Example: NUMERIC(10,2) can store a total of 10 digits with 2 decimal places.

2. Go:
   - decimal.Decimal: From the "github.com/shopspring/decimal" package. This type provides arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic.
   - float64: Built-in type, but be cautious about potential precision issues with floating-point arithmetic.

3. HTMX (HTML/JavaScript):
   - In HTML forms: Use <input type="number" step="0.01"> for user input.
   - In JavaScript: Store as a string to preserve precision, or use a library like decimal.js for calculations.

When passing data between these systems:

1. Store and retrieve from PostgreSQL using NUMERIC.
2. In Go, use decimal.Decimal for calculations and database operations.
3. For HTMX, send the value as a string to preserve precision, parse it on the client-side if needed for display or calculation.

This approach ensures consistent and precise handling of monetary values across your stack. Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?
